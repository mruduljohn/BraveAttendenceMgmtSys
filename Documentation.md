# Design & Specification

## Project Name : Attendence Management System


## System Overview

The project is an **Attendance Management System** designed to track employee attendance, manage leave requests, and generate attendance reports. The system will allow users to clock in and clock out (using Face ID), track working hours, manage time off requests, and allow managers and admins to generate reports. The system will be role-based with different access levels for Admins, Managers, and Employees.

### Key Features:
- User Authentication & Authorization
- Clock In/Out (with Face ID verification)
- Leave Requests & Approval
- Attendance Reports Generation
- Role-Based Access (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Notifications for Clock In/Out Reminders
- User Profile Management

## List of Features to Be Implemented

### User Authentication & Authorization
- **Login/Logout**: Users can log in with their credentials and log out of the system.
